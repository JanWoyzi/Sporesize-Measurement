## Abstract
Measuring spore size is a standard method for the description of fungal taxa, but results in nothing more than a size range. We present a method to analyze the shape of large quantities of spherical bodies, like spores or pollen, without using expensive equipment. A spore suspension mounted at a slide is treated with a high-vibration device to achieve a uniform distribution of spores. Subsequent automated image processing allows to measure between 10 000 and 50 000 spores per slide. One result is a size distribution of spores, which can yield a lot of additional information, as shown on the example of the slime mold *Physarum albescens*. The exact distribution curves for spore size reveal irregularities in spore formation, as a result of the influence of environmental conditions on spore maturation. A comparison of the spore size distribution curves within and between colonies of sporocarps shows a high degree of environmental variation together with apparent genetic variation. In addition, some of the specimens have a proportion of apparently unreduced spores, which have roughly twice the volume of normal spores. Here we give a detailed guideline for slide preparation and image processing scripts, which can be universally used for spherical bodies like spores or pollen grains, and describe conceivable applications.
